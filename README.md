# Test you Mapbox Studio Tiles in Tableau
This is a very simple tool to see how your Mapbox Studio styles will perform in Tableau.

Currently, Mapbox doesn't have a way to preview your Studio styles in Tableau.

To help with the final stages of testing before you put your map in Tableau, I've built a very small webpage to preview your tiles.

It's a two step process:

First, go to your [Studio account](https://www.mapbox.com/studio) and copy the **Share this style** URL.

Second, go [here](http://cmtoomey.github.io/MapboxTableauTesting/) and paste in the URL you just copied.

Your new map will load and will zoom you to your approximate location. Feel free to zoom around and see how all your tiles look.
